## Assumptions
The run analysis.R script assumes that the test data is at the root of the working directory.  i.e., there is a dir for test, another for train and at least the text files features.txt and activity_labels.txt at the root.

## Read in the test and training data
The script first reads in the test and training data, and appends the subject and activity id fields to each.  It then combines the two data sets into a single data set to be processed (full_data).

## Import descriptive names for activities and column headers
The script then reads in the activity names and column headers to be used in the final data set and creates a vector of column headers to be applied to the full_data set.

## Parse out data we are interested in (means, standard deviations)
Since we are only interested in mean and standard deviation data, we split those columns from the full data set for further work (split_data).

We then replace activity id with an actual descriptive activity name and melt the data set and get rid of data we are not interested in.  We end up with the resultant data set md_test, which has only the data we are interested in.

## Group, aggregate and spread the data into a final tidy data set
Finally, we group the data and apply the mean function, to display only the mean of each of the readings for individual acitivity/participant combination.  Ignoring NAs which are irrelevant to the final result, we select the data we want, rename the columns with appropriate values and spread the result to get our final tidy data set "finaladd".


# Data Source
The full source data set contains several files, of which this script uses the following:

* 'features.txt': List of all features.
* 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
* 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
* 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
* 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
* 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
* 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

## Description of source data (from their README.txt)
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

# Final tidy dataset column descriptions (finaladd)

### SubjectID
Id of each of 30 subjects,  range from 1 to 30.

### ActivityID
One of six ActivityIDs:  LAYING, SITTING, STANDING, WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS

### Feature Measurements Description (from features_info.txt in original dataset)
Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
